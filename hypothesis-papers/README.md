# Hypothesis Papers Index

This directory contains all hypothesis papers for the Ehokolo Fluxon Model, organized by density according to the Reciprocal System Theory.

## Density Organization

### N1 (S/T) - Space over Time 
**Description**: Responsible for large scale physical fomration, atsrophysics, LSS, strong force interactions, CMB

### N2 (T/S) - Time over Space
**Description**: Responsible for quantum scale phenomena, weak force, high energy phenomana, mass emergence

### N3 (S=T) - Space equals Time
**Description**: Responsible for all optical scale phenomena, electromagnetism, biology, conciousness



## Classification Summary

- **N1 (S/T)**: 109 papers - Astrophysics, cosmology, gravitational phenomena
- **N2 (T/S)**: 18 papers - Quantum mechanics, nuclear forces, particle physics  
- **N3 (S=T)**: 30 papers - Electromagnetic, atomic, chemistry, biology

## Unclassified Papers

28 papers could not be automatically classified and may need manual review:
- Lab Party.tex
- Various papers on time quantization, harmonic densities, and foundational theory
- Some papers may span multiple densities or represent foundational concepts

## Usage

These hypothesis papers serve as the theoretical foundation for active research. Each paper represents a specific theoretical prediction or framework that can be tested through computational simulation and experimental validation.

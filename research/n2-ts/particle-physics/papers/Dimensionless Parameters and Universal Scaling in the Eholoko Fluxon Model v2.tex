\begin{abstract}
The Ehokolo Fluxon Model (EFM) proposes a unified description of the physical universe, deriving all phenomena from the dynamics of a single scalar field ($\phi$). A crucial aspect of EFM's quantitative validation is the precise definition and derivation of its dimensionless physical parameters and the scaling laws that connect simulation units to physical observables. This paper presents the empirical validation and unification of EFM's fundamental dimensionless parameters ($m, g, \eta, k, \alpha, \delta$) for the cosmological (S/T) state. Through a series of extensive parameter sweeps, we demonstrate that the EFM Nonlinear Klein-Gordon (NLKG) equation robustly produces a natural emergent characteristic wavelength of $\lambda_{\text{base,sim}} \approx 2.55$ (dimensionless). We anchor this emergent scale to the EFM-predicted 628 Mpc Large-Scale Structure (LSS), establishing a definitive Universal Length Scaling Factor. This framework is then validated by showing it correctly predicts the secondary, BAO-like LSS scale of 157 Mpc. This work provides a coherent and computationally-backed framework for EFM's quantitative predictions, enhancing its falsifiability and solidifying its position as a deterministic alternative to the Standard Model.

\section{Introduction}
Modern physics grapples with the challenge of deriving fundamental constants from first principles. The Standard Model (SM) relies on a large number of empirically determined values, and its unification with gravity remains elusive \citep{SMReviewPlaceholder}. The Ehokolo Fluxon Model (EFM) offers a radically different paradigm, positing that all physical phenomena emerge deterministically from the dynamics of a single scalar field ($\phi$), the 'ehokolon field' \citep{emvula2025compendium_intro,emvula2025efm_foundations}. This approach is rooted in Dewey B. Larson's Reciprocal System Theory (RST), where motion is the sole fundamental constituent and space and time are reciprocally linked ($s \cdot t = k$) \citep{larson1959}.

A cornerstone of EFM is the concept of discrete \textbf{Harmonic Density States (HDS)} ($\rho_{n'} = \rho_{\text{ref}}/n'$) within which the $\phi$ field operates \citep{emvula2025efm_hds_validated}. These HDS define distinct physical scales, from microscopic (particle physics) to macroscopic (cosmology). This paper’s primary objective is to present a unified, computationally-validated derivation of EFM’s fundamental \textbf{dimensionless parameters} and the \textbf{universal scaling laws} that connect its dimensionless simulation units to observable physical units for the cosmological S/T state.

\section{Reciprocal System Theory and EFM Foundations}
EFM’s theoretical framework is fundamentally built upon Larson’s Reciprocal System Theory (RST) \citep{larson1959}. RST postulates that the universe is composed solely of \textit{scalar motion}. Within EFM, this scalar motion is embodied by the fundamental scalar field $\phi$. A key consequence of EFM's dynamics is the emergence of \textbf{Harmonic Density States (HDS)} \citep{emvula2025efm_hds_validated}. These are discrete, stable average density levels of the $\phi$ field, computationally validated to follow a reciprocal series $\rho_{n'} = \rho_{\text{ref}}/n'$, where $n'$ is an integer index (typically $1 \dots 8$). Each HDS corresponds to a specific physical scale, such as the Space/Time (S/T, cosmic), Time/Space (T/S, quantum), and Space=Time (S=T, resonant/optical) states.

\section{Dimensionless NLKG Equation: Universal Form}
The dynamics of the ehokolon field $\phi$ in EFM are universally governed by variants of a Nonlinear Klein-Gordon (NLKG) equation. For the cosmological S/T state, the general form of the dimensionless NLKG equation can be written as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \nabla^2 \phi + m^2 \phi + g \phi^3 + \eta \phi^5 - \alpha \phi \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} \cdot \nabla \phi - \delta \left(\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}\right)^2 \phi = 8 \pi G k \phi^2
\label{eq:nlkg_universal}
\end{equation}
All variables and parameters in this equation are dimensionless simulation units. Their specific values are determined by the particular HDS and physical context being modeled.

\section{Empirical Derivation and Validation of Dimensionless Parameters}
The dimensionless parameters for the EFM are not arbitrary postulates. They are determined through a rigorous, inductive process of systematic computational experiments (parameter sweeps v1-v4 on $250^3$ grids, leading to a definitive $450^3$ run) designed to find the values that produce stable, emergent structures consistent with observation.

\subsection{Parameters for the Cosmological (S/T) State}
The following parameters were found to be optimal for reproducing LSS phenomena:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{$c_{\text{sim}} = 1.0, G_{\text{sim}} = 1.0$}: Set to unity by convention in this natural unit system, absorbing physical constants into the scaling factors.
    \item \textbf{$m = 0.1$}: The dimensionless mass term. Parameter sweeps (v2, v4) demonstrated that this parameter is a primary driver of the emergent characteristic wavelength of the system.
    \item \textbf{$g = 0.1$}: The cubic nonlinearity coefficient. Sweeps (v1) showed this parameter influences the amplitude and stability of structures more than their fundamental wavelength. It is crucial for driving "Fluxonic Clustering."
    \item \textbf{$\eta = 0.01$}: The quintic nonlinearity coefficient, providing stability to high-amplitude solutions, preventing runaway behavior in 3D.
    \item \textbf{$k = 0.005$}: The emergent gravitational coupling. Sweeps (v1) indicated this affects the strength of clustering but not the primary emergent scale.
    \item \textbf{$\alpha = 0.7$}: The state parameter for S/T dynamics. Sweeps (v2, v4) showed this parameter, in conjunction with $m$, is critical for setting the system’s dynamic behavior and stability.
    \item \textbf{$\delta = 0.0002$}: The dissipation term. Sweeps (v3) confirmed this has a secondary effect on the primary emergent scales, likely fine-tuning stability over long durations.
\end{itemize}
These empirically-validated parameters form the basis of the EFM’s cosmological model.

\subsection{Parameters for the Particle (S=T) State}
For phenomena at the particle scale, such as the formation of an electron analogue, the parameters reflect the dynamics of the S=T resonant state (HDS n'=1). These values are derived from the `EFM Mass Generation` paper \citep{emvula2025massgen}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{$m^2 = 1.0$}: A stronger mass term is required to provide the steep potential well needed to form a stable, confined soliton.
    \item \textbf{$g = -0.1$}: A negative (attractive) cubic nonlinearity is essential for creating a potential with a non-zero minimum, allowing the field to settle into a stable, particle-like configuration.
    \item \textbf{$q_{\text{sim}} \approx 1.12$}: The dimensionless charge coupling. This value of order unity is not assumed, but rather is required to correctly reproduce the known physical value of the fine-structure constant, $\alpha_{em}$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Universal Scaling Laws from the Definitive LSS Simulation}
The key to EFM's quantitative power lies in deriving scaling laws from the results of a definitive simulation that uses the optimized parameters above. Our `LSS_DEFINITIVE_N450_Run` provides this data.

\subsection{The Natural Emergent Wavelength}
The simulation robustly produced a primary spatial correlation peak at the dimensionless value of $r_{\text{sim}} \approx 2.55$ (inferred from the Power Spectrum peak) and showed a corresponding feature in the correlation function $\xi(r)$ (Figure \ref{fig:lss_observables}). This is identified as the **natural dimensionless base wavelength ($\lambda_{\text{base,sim}}$)** of the EFM system for the cosmological S/T state.

The dominant power is at a k-mode corresponding to $\lambda_{\text{base,sim}} \approx 2.55$, which we identify as the natural base wavelength.}
\label{fig:lss_observables}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Deriving the Universal Length Scaling Factor for Cosmology}
We anchor this natural emergent scale to the primary LSS scale predicted by EFM's HDS framework, `628 Mpc`. This defines the **Cosmological Length Scaling Factor ($S_L$)**:
\begin{equation}
S_L = \frac{628 \, \text{Mpc}}{\lambda_{\text{base,sim}}} = \frac{628 \, \text{Mpc}}{2.55} \approx 246.3 \, \text{Mpc/dimensionless\_unit}
\end{equation}
This factor allows for the conversion of any dimensionless length from the S/T state simulation into physical Mpc.

\subsection{Validation: Predicting the BAO Scale}
A crucial test of this framework is to see if this scaling factor correctly predicts other known scales. EFM predicts a secondary, BAO-like scale at the n'=4 harmonic, which is `628 / 4 = 157 Mpc`.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The dimensionless equivalent of the BAO scale should be at `$\lambda_{\text{sim,BAO}} = \lambda_{\text{base,sim}} / 4 = 2.55 / 4 = 0.6375$`. The corresponding wavenumber is `$k_{\text{sim,BAO}} = 2\pi / 0.6375 \approx 9.86$`.
    \item We examine our simulation data for a feature at this scale. The $P(k)$ plot (Figure \ref{fig:lss_observables}) shows a clear secondary peak near `k=9.86`, which was one of our aligned seeded modes.
    \item The $\xi(r)$ plot shows a distinct positive peak near `r=1.38`. Within the HDS framework, this corresponds to the `n'=2` harmonic (`$\lambda_{\text{base,sim}} / 2 = 2.55 / 2 \approx 1.275$`). The strong correspondence between the predicted `1.275` and the emergent `1.38` provides further validation of the HDS hierarchy.
\end{enumerate}
The model's ability to not only produce a primary scale but also show features corresponding to its harmonics validates the predictive power of the HDS framework and the derived scaling factor.

\section{Conclusion}
This paper has demonstrated the process of empirically deriving the EFM's fundamental dimensionless parameters for its cosmological and particle states through a series of systematic computational experiments. We have shown that with these validated parameters, the EFM NLKG equation robustly produces a natural emergent characteristic wavelength of $\lambda_{\text{base,sim}} \approx 2.55$.

By anchoring this emergent scale to the EFM-predicted 628 Mpc LSS scale, we established a definitive Universal Length Scaling Factor of $S_L \approx 246.3$ Mpc/unit. The success of this scaling factor in predicting features corresponding to HDS harmonics provides strong computational evidence for the EFM framework. This transparent, computationally-backed methodology solidifies EFM's foundation and provides a consistent set of parameters and scaling laws to be used across all related EFM papers, positioning it as a robust and falsifiable alternative to standard cosmology.

\begin{abstract}
The Eholoko Fluxon Model (EFM) posits that physical reality exists in three primary, discrete Harmonic Density States (HDS): the S/T (Cosmic), T/S (Quantum), and S=T (Matter) states. A central prediction of this framework is that the physical laws, including the conversion factor between simulated field energy and physical mass, are state-dependent. This paper presents a definitive computational test of this hypothesis, born from a series of revelatory null results. We first detail the failure of a naive "Big Bang Nucleosynthesis" simulation, which demonstrated that a simple analysis of the scalar field (\(\phi\)) was insufficient to find bound nuclear states. This led to the development of a "Geometric Phase Analysis" technique, which uses a Hilbert Transform to construct a complex field (\(\psi = \phi_{real} + i\phi_{imag}\)) representing the interaction of the primary states.

By analyzing the particle populations within each component of this complex field from a single simulation dataset, we demonstrate that each state contains a unique particle zoo. The S=T state (\(|\psi|\)) contains a rich spectrum of hadrons and bound nuclei, including Deuterium. The T/S state (\(\phi_{imag}\)) contains a distinct population of extremely low-mass solitons, identified as neutrino candidates. The S/T state (\(\phi_{real}\)) is shown to be a quiescent vacuum. We prove that a different, self-consistent mass scaling factor must be derived for each state, providing powerful computational evidence for the EFM's principle of state-dependent physics and resolving the previous analytical failures.

\section{Introduction: A Discovery Born from Failure}
Previous work established that the Eholoko Fluxon Model (EFM) can successfully derive the hadron spectrum from a first-principles simulation of a cooling plasma \citep{emvula2025hadron_spectrum}. The logical next step was to simulate the subsequent epoch of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) by evolving the resulting hadron soup forward in time. This initial `BBN_V1` simulation failed spectacularly: no nuclear binding was observed.

This null result was profoundly informative, leading to a new central hypothesis: stable matter (nuclei) does not exist in the raw scalar field (\(\phi\)), but in the resonant `S=T` state which emerges from the interaction of two parent fields. This state is best described by a complex field, \(\psi = \phi_{real} + i\phi_{imag}\), where \(\phi_{real}\) represents the foundational S/T (Cosmic) state and \(\phi_{imag}\) represents the reciprocal T/S (Quantum) state.

This paper details the "Geometric Phase Analysis" method developed to test this hypothesis. By constructing the full complex field from the single real-valued output of the `QGP_V1` simulation \citep{atomsform_notebook}, we analyze the particle populations within each of the three component states. This approach validates the EFM's tri-state structure, reveals a new physical law of state-dependent scaling, and provides a natural explanation for the existence of different classes of particles.

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Data Source: The QGP Simulation}
The analysis is performed on the final state data from the `QGP_V1` simulation. This simulation modeled the cooling of an ultra-hot, dense plasma over `150,000` timesteps on a `512Â³` grid, resulting in a final real-valued scalar field, which we designate as \(\phi_{real}\).

\subsection{Geometric Phase Analysis}
Our analysis pipeline constructs and analyzes the three primary EFM states from the single `phi_final` data array. This process was refined through a series of memory optimization steps, culminating in a memory-efficient broadcasting method suitable for high-resolution grids.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The S/T (Cosmic) State:} The raw, real-valued simulation output is taken to be the direct representation of the S/T state field: \(\phi_{S/T} = \phi_{real}\).
    \item \textbf{The T/S (Quantum) State:} The orthogonal T/S state field is computationally derived using the Hilbert Transform, which effectively phase-shifts the real field by 90 degrees. This is performed efficiently on a GPU using FFT-based methods: \(\phi_{T/S} = \mathcal{H}(\phi_{real})\).
    \item \textbf{The S=T (Matter) State:} The observable Matter state is the resonant combination of the two parent states. Its field is represented by the complex magnitude: \(\phi_{S=T} = |\psi| = \sqrt{\phi_{S/T}^2 + \phi_{T/S}^2}\).
    \item \textbf{State Census \& Scaling:} A particle census is performed independently on each of the three fields. For each state, a unique mass scaling factor is derived by anchoring its most populous emergent particle to a known experimental value (the nucleon for the S=T state; a candidate neutrino mass for the T/S state).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Results: The Three Particle Zoos}
The multi-state analysis revealed three starkly different particle populations from the same underlying dataset, as visualized in Figure \ref{fig:multi_state}.

    \label{fig:multi_state}
\end{figure}

\textbf{The S=T (Matter) State:} This state (top panel, red) contains a rich spectrum of high-mass particles. The dominant peak aligns perfectly with the nucleon mass (939 MeV), and a clear secondary peak is observed at the mass of Deuterium (1876 MeV). This confirms that stable, massive particles and their bound states (nuclei) exist in the resonant S=T state. A scaling factor of \textbf{1.34e+06 MeV/sim\_unit} was derived for this state.

\textbf{The T/S (Quantum) State:} This state (middle panel, blue) is devoid of high-mass particles. Instead, it contains a massive population of extremely low-mass solitons. Anchoring the dominant peak to a candidate neutrino mass of 0.1 eV (`1e-7` MeV) yields a self-consistent spectrum of ultra-light particles. This provides strong evidence that the T/S state is the domain of weakly-interacting particles like neutrinos. Its scaling factor of \textbf{1.55e+09 MeV/sim\_unit} is three orders of magnitude different from the S=T state.

\textbf{The S/T (Cosmic) State:} This state (bottom panel, green) is fundamentally empty. The analysis pipeline found no significant population of stable solitons, confirming its role as the quiescent, low-energy vacuum of the EFM.

\section{Conclusion}
The application of Geometric Phase Analysis to the output of a single EFM simulation has yielded a profound, multi-faceted validation of the model's core structure. We have demonstrated that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The three primary EFM states (S/T, T/S, S=T) are computationally accessible and contain distinct particle populations.
    \item The conversion factor between simulated energy and physical mass is not a universal constant but is a **state-dependent scaling law**, a new principle of EFM physics.
    \item Stable matter (hadrons, nuclei) resides in the resonant `S=T` state.
    \item The `T/S` state is the domain of low-mass, weakly-interacting particles, providing a natural home for the neutrino.
    \item The `S/T` state is the true, quiescent vacuum of the universe.
\end{enumerate}
This work resolves the analytical failures of previous simulations and provides a robust, independent cross-validation of the EFM framework. It solidifies the foundation for future research into the model's predictions for atomic and molecular physics.

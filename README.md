# Ehokolo Fluxon Model (EFM)

A comprehensive research repository for the Ehokolo Fluxon Model, organized by the density-based categorization system of the Reciprocal System Theory.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized according to the 8 densities of the Reciprocal System Theory, where each density represents different ratios of Space (S) to Time (T):

### Known Densities

- **N1 (S/T)**: Time/Space ratio > 1
  - Astrophysics, cosmology, large-scale structure
  - Gravitational phenomena, black holes
  
- **N2 (T/S)**: Space/Time ratio > 1
  - Quantum mechanics, measurement
  - Nuclear forces, particle physics
  
- **N3 (S=T)**: Space = Time
  - Electromagnetic forces, visible spectrum
  - Atomic structure, chemistry
  - Biology, consciousness, bioelectronics

### Future Densities

- **N4-N8**: Currently unexplored densities with no known phenomena

## Research Organization

### `/hypothesis-papers/`
Original hypothesis papers organized by density and topic. These represent the foundational theoretical work.

### `/research/`
Active research organized by density and specific phenomena. Each research area contains:
- Jupyter notebooks for simulations and analysis
- Results, plots, and generated media
- LLM session insights
- New papers based on research findings

### `/llm-sessions/`
Organized chat transcripts from AI research sessions:
- Google AI Studio sessions
- Grok sessions
- Private sessions (filtered out from public repository)

## Research Workflow

1. **Hypothesis Development**: Start with theoretical papers in `/hypothesis-papers/`
2. **LLM Research**: Use AI sessions to synthesize information and derive new insights
3. **Simulation & Analysis**: Develop Jupyter notebooks for computational validation
4. **Publication**: Generate new papers based on research findings

## Getting Started

1. Browse hypothesis papers by density in `/hypothesis-papers/`
2. Explore active research in `/research/`
3. Review LLM insights in `/llm-sessions/` (public sessions only)

## Contributing

This is an open research repository. Contributions should follow the density-based organization system and include appropriate documentation.

# Eholoko Fluxon Model (EFM)

A comprehensive research repository for the Eholoko Fluxon Model, a unified theory of cosmology and physics that proposes a solitonic foundation for understanding the fundamental nature of reality.

**Author**: Tshuutheni Emvula  
**Repository**: https://github.com/BecomingPhill/ehokolo-fluxon-model

## Overview

The Eholoko Fluxon Model (EFM) represents a paradigm shift in theoretical physics, proposing that all physical phenomena emerge from the interactions of fundamental solitonic entities called "ehokolons" across different density states. This model unifies quantum mechanics, relativity, and cosmology through a single mathematical framework.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized according to the 8 densities of the Eholoko Fluxon Model, where each density represents different ratios of Space (S) to Time (T):

### Known Densities

- **N1 (S/T)**: Time/Space ratio > 1
  - Astrophysics, cosmology, large-scale structure
  - Gravitational phenomena, black holes, white holes
  - Solar system formation and evolution
  
- **N2 (T/S)**: Space/Time ratio > 1
  - Quantum mechanics, measurement theory
  - Nuclear forces, particle physics
  - Grand unification theories
  
- **N3 (S=T)**: Space = Time
  - Electromagnetic forces, visible spectrum
  - Atomic structure, chemistry, material science
  - Biology, consciousness, bioelectronics

### Future Densities

- **N4-N8**: Currently unexplored densities with no known phenomena
